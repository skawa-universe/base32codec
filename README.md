# base32codec

A Base32 codec using idiomatic dart.

The `Base32Encoder` and `Base32Decoder` class extends the `Converter` class,
there's a `Base32Codec` class that extends the `Codec` class quite similar how
Base64 encoding was implemented in `dart:convert`.

There's a `base32` constant that can be used for encoding and decoding.
